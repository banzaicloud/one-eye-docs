To install the One Eye, [register for an evaluation version](/products/try-one-eye/) and run the following command to install the CLI tool:

{{< include-headless "download-oneeye.md" >}}

The script automatically chooses the best distribution package for your platform.

Available packages:

- Deb package --- for latest Ubuntu LTS and Debian stable releases
- RPM package --- for latest CentOS, RHEL, SLES or openSUSE releases
- binary tarballs for Linux and macOS (x86_64).

You can also select the installation method (one of `auto`, `deb`, `rpm`, `brew`, `tar`) explicitly:

{{< include-headless "download-oneeye-deb.md" >}}

On macOS, you can install the CLI directly from ***Homebrew***.
